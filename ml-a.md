## Machine Learning Algorithms

1. How many or how much of something? (Regression)

2. Is this observation A or B (or C or D) (Classification)

3. What groupings exist in the data already (Clustering)

4. What should I do next? What will likely happen? (Time Series)

5. Is this thing weird? (Anomaly Detection)
